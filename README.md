Purpose of this repository

To keep my first projects on github.

1: airbnb toppage copy
This is before I learned about responsive websites.
I was able to make a copy of airbnb's website's top page.
Back them I hadn't learned javascript so there is a few codes of js.

2: second content with html/css/js
I tried to make something portfolio like websites using html/css/js.
Also the main focus here was to make it responsive.
