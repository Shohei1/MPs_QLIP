Purpose of this repository

To keep my first projects on github.

1: airbnb toppage copy
This is before I learned about responsive websites.
I was able to make a copy of airbnb's website's top page.
Back them I hadn't learned javascript so there is a few codes of js.

2: second content with html/css/js
I tried to make something portfolio like websites using html/css/js.
Also the main focus here was to make it responsive.
Using node.js or php was a bit challenging so I used them in the next project.

3: MyPeople
I was able to use node.js, database and scss on this project.

4: React app
I used firebase and react to deploy my first react app.
