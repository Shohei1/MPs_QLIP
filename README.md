Purpose of this repository

To keep my first projects on github.

1: airbnb toppage copy.

This is before I learned about responsive websites.
I was able to make a copy of airbnb's website's top page.
Back them I hadn't learned javascript so there is a few codes of js.

2: second content with html/css/js.

I tried to make something portfolio like websites using html/css/js.
Also the main focus here was to make it responsive.
Using node.js or php was a bit challenging so I used them in the next project.

3: MyPeople.

I used node.js, database and scss on this project.

4: React app.

I used firebase and react to deploy my first react app.
Since I could not upload the whole files, only components and views are on github.

5: Awa_short.（A group project）

Files that I was involved were added to this file.
My role was mainly backend and I was invloved with controllers, models, migration and seeding files, blade files, and a routing file.

6: first_TypeScript.

The record of studying typescript since 2022/09/03 is in this holder.

7: first_Nextjs_TypeSript

This folder contains my first Next.js projects.
